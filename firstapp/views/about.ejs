  <h1>About Our Team's GPT Programs</h1>
  
  <h2>Tianling's Demo</h2>
  <p>Tianling's demo showcases a program that generates interesting and creative responses about programming languages when given a prompt. The program uses OpenAI's GPT to create these responses. It takes user input, which consists of programming languages or related topics, and returns a generated response based on the input.</p>
  
  <h3>Sample Prompt and Answer:</h3>
  <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> java and python</p>
  <p><strong>Response:</strong> Java and Python are both high-level programming languages. Java is a statically-typed language that is class-based, while Python is a dynamically-typed language that is object-oriented. Both languages are extremely popular and are used in a wide range of applications. Python is used for building data science, AI, and web applications, while Java is used for developing highly scalable, secure, and robust applications.</p>
